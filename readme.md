## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I use the shortcodes?**
A: Simply add the desired shortcode (e.g., `[student_search]`) to any WordPress page or post using the text editor or a shortcode block in the block editor.

**Q: Can I customize the certificate PDF design beyond the admin settings?**
A: Yes, the PDF generation logic is primarily within <mcfile name="student-certificate-search.php" path="c:\Users\eshaa\Local Sites\test\app\public\wp-content\plugins\certificate-generator\includes\student-certificate-search.php"></mcfile> (specifically functions like `generate_certificate_pdf`) and uses the FPDF library. Developers can modify this code or use hooks (if available/added) to further customize the PDF output.

**Q: Where are generated certificates stored?**
A: Generated PDF certificates are typically stored in the WordPress uploads directory, within a subdirectory like `certificates`.

**Q: What happens if a student or school has multiple certificates?**
A: The search results will display all associated certificates. For bulk downloads, a single ZIP file containing all these individual PDF certificates will be created.
